## Stroop Effect: Statistical Analysis of a Perceptual Phenomenon

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant's task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. 
The task has two conditions: 


1. **Congruent words condition** - words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example, 

```diff
+ GREEN
- RED
```


2. **Incongruent words condition** - words being displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example,

```diff
+ RED
- GREEN
```


In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
