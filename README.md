# Stroop Effect: Statistical Analysis of a Perceptual Phenomenon

***by Maneesh Divana***

----------

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant's task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. 
The task has two conditions: 


1. **Congruent words condition** - words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style="color:red"><em>RED</em></span>, <span style="color:blue"><em>BLUE</em></span>.


2. **Incongruent words condition** - words being displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style="color:orange"><em>PURPLE</em></span>, <span style="color:purple"><em>ORANGE</em></span>. 


In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
